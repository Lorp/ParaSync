# ParaSync

A web app to test multiple parametric variable fonts at the same time to compare how they react to identical parametric settings.

[**Launch ParaSync now**](https://lorp.github.io/parasync/parasync.html)

Users can drag their own fonts onto the app.

ParaSync has only one set of parametric axes controls. These settings are applied to all pre-loaded fonts and all drag-dropped fonts. To avoid other axes confusing the comparison, ParaSync sets all non-editable axes in each font to their default values.

The set of parametric axes in the UI is currently fixed.

Please feel free to use ParaSync in your own testing and for private and public demos of parametric fonts. Contact the author for licensing.
